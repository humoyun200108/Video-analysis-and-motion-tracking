🚀 Real-Time Object Detection and Tracking 🎥
Welcome to the YOLOv5-powered video analysis project! 👋
Detect and track objects in real-time using cutting-edge YOLOv5, OpenCV, and a clean web interface. 🌐

🧐 What does this project do?
This project provides a web-based solution to:
✅ Detect objects in videos using YOLOv5 🧠
✅ Track the motion of detected objects 🎯
✅ Process videos efficiently and output enhanced results 🚀

It's perfect for video surveillance, traffic monitoring, and any use case requiring object detection & tracking. 🚦

🛠️ Tech Stack
YOLOv5 🧠 - State-of-the-art object detection model.
PyTorch ⚡ - Backbone for YOLOv5.
OpenCV 👁️ - Real-time image processing.
MoviePy 🎬 - For seamless video input/output.
NumPy 📊 - For image data handling.
Web Interface 🌐 - User-friendly and interactive.
🎥 How It Works
Load the YOLOv5 model and detect objects in video frames.
Track the motion of objects across frames.
Output the processed video with bounding boxes 🎯 and object labels.
